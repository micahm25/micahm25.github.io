Over the summer, I had the opportunity to intern in the project management office for the Bank of Hawaii. It was their first virtual internship program, and certainly my first time working a job completely from my own home. 
There was a large learning curve involved with navigating the corporate world from my bedroom, including virtual meetings, internet connectivity issues, and overall learning how to work remotely. This internship experience was very enriching as a college student. Not only did I garner valuable relationships for my career going forth, I also developed a sense of grit working through the adversities of a virtual internship.
Looking to the future, I cannot wait to apply my new skills to my next internship, whether it be in person or virtual.
