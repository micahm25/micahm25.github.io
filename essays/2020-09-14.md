This WOD was the hardest of the three. In my first attempt, I went over the DNF time and eventually had to stop and watch the solution. The reason I had to stop was because I simply could not think of how to complete some of the steps.
I stopped my first attempt and went back to readings to see if it would help. After still no answers, I watched the solution to figure out where I went wrong. During my second attempt, it went a lot more smoothly. I got within Rx time and properly completed the assignment.
My advice for this WOD is that it is okay to fact-find using google to help with CSS during the timed attempt. Moreover, if you figure out a way to complete the task while deviating from the solution, use that method.
