The first HTML WOD was somewhat easy for me. I already had a basic understanding of HTML and could construct a simple webpage fairly easy. The hard part of this assignment was the time constraint. I did my first attempt fairly easily, but I did not initially get the webpage done in Rx time. There were many different steps and I took my time to ensure each step was properly done.
After the first attempt, I realized that I should code with better effiency. I watched the solution, and found some methods to speed up my time. Enabling wrap text and using intellisense surely sped up my time on the second attempt, and I was able to complete it in Rx time. 

My advice would be to use your first attempt as a learning trial. Don't worry about time and just play around with the code until you fully understand how to fulfill the assignment. Then you can watch the solution or head straight into the second attempt. Use this attempt to speed up your time and try to get in Rx time. During this attempt, you should already know what to code and how to code it in an efficient time.
