This WOD was actually the easiest for me. I got it done in 1 attempt in Rx time. Prior to the attempt, I thoroughly read through the instructions and wrote down what I think would need to be coded to achieve the end result.
I also employed my fact-finding skills to research some CSS methods to complete the nav bar. I was surprised after watching the solution and how different the approaches were, but with the same end result. 
I also used the inspect tool to help with the spacing for the nav bar which was helpful with spacing.
